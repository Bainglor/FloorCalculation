Unfortunetly I do not have enough time to run the code for 32x10. The possible permutations are 
3329^10 = 1.671621512572349E+35.
I did run he code successfully for over 6 hours. There where no memory leaks and it was stable.
When I am back to working from home I will run it again.
Included is the log output for 9x3 which confirms the 8 valid floor layouts.
If I had more time I would like to add DI and Unit Testing.

Expectations.

//32x10
int max = 16;
int min = 10;
length = 32;
width = 10;

//10x3
int max = 5;
int min = 3;
length = 10;
width = 3;

//9x3
int max = 4;
int min = 3;
length = 9;
width = 3;

//5x3
int max = 2;
int min = 1;
ength = 5;
width = 3;
